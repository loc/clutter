<h2>v0.7.5</h2>
<p>Adding analytics so I can see how the app is used. No file information (except for file size) or personal information is sent. I'll be writing a privacy policy with more details soon, but I'm erring on the side of being too careful with information.
<br>
Also in this release are a few tweaks to the UX. Now the app stays in front on confirm when you've opened it from the menu. Row index state is preserved across table view modes, too.

<h2>v0.7.4</h2>
<p>Fixed a new install crash for real this time. Also correctly responding to interaction with the file expiration notification.</p>

<br/> <hr/> <br/>

<h2>v0.7.3</h2>
<p>Fixed (hopefully) a crash on open for new installs</p>

<br/> <hr/> <br/>


<h2>v0.7.2</h2>
<p>Right click on the icon now brings up Quit menu. Fixed weird 11 months ago bug when file was last modified today.</p>

<br/> <hr/> <br/>

<h2>v0.7.1</h2>
<p>Adding quick look functionality. When a file is selected, hit spacebar for a bigger preview of the file.</p>

<br/> <hr/> <br/>

<h2>v0.7.0</h2>
<h4>So many changes!</h4>
<p>This version is a minor bump because there are a lot of changes to the interface (as well as behind the scenes) but I don't feel like it's stable enough to get to v1.0.0. Most apparent is the adoption of the tabbed interface that allows you to switch from Unsorted, Fresh and Expired files. Other things fixed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Several memory leaks fixed</li>
	<li>Switched to Autolayout for the entire app</li>
	<li>Added some redundency for the serialization loading</li>
	<li>Restore expired files</li>
	<li>Many many interface tweaks that didn't make too much sense in the last version</li>
	<li>Batch notifications for multiple file expirations</li>
</ul>

<p>I've also created a <a href="https://trello.com/b/aidyHP6N/clutter">Trello board</a> for bug tracking and feature requests. Please message me to get access.</p>
